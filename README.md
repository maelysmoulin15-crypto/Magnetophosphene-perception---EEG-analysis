EEG Signals â€” Magnetic Field (MF) Exposure
Slicing Raw EEG Signals into Epochs

This repository contains MATLAB scripts to preprocess EEG recordings acquired during magnetic field (MF) exposure experiments.
The main script scans raw EEG files, detects stimulation onsets, and slices the continuous EEG into 55 aligned epochs (5 s each) according to the predefined randomization order.
